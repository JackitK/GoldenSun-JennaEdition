# Golden Sun: Jenna Edition
Golden Sun 1 with Jenna inserted into Garret's place includes Jenna's stats, class and Psynergy from Lost Age. Also includes various quailty of life improvements for the game via the "Convenience Version"...

# Convenience Verison
The convenience version has features to improve overworld traveling, that I first implemented in Dawn of Djinn.  Including...
- Skipping the prolouge, as well as Flint's tutorial.
- Being able to use Retreat as fast travel on the world map (as well as warping to the entrance of towns)
- This does come at the cost of Bilbin Barricade (mostly) no longer existing in order to give a map marker to another part of the game.
- Avoid not only being available from the start, but it now behaves as a literal on/off toggle, rather than how it behaves in vanilla.
- Scared Feathers now takes on an effect similar to the Djinni Quartz (60% chance to revive ally to half health)
- Quartz's abilty now acts as a 80 HP heal that is guartneed to revive if the ally is down.
- All Psynergy that is strictly ulity costs 0 PP.
- A fire Psynergy equilvant to Growth, "Sunshine", is available on Jenna, regardless of her class.
- Ivan gains a new Psynergy, Gust, regardless of his class. It is an ulitiy exclusive Psynergy that functions like Whirlwind.
- Mia gains a new Psynergy, "Holy Ply" outside of battle it lets you solve the puzzles of the Mercury Lighthouse. In battle, it heals PP to the user. Mia will have access to this Psynergy, regardless of class.
- Ply from the orginal game is now refered to as "Healing Ply"
-Frost and Douse are battle exclusive Psynergy with "Chill" and "Rain" acting as their utility equivalent.
- Douse Drop and Frost Gem now bestow Rain, and Chill respectully when equipped.
- Chill and Rain also appear in more classes than vanilla.
- The Shaman's Rod also bestows Rain when equipped, instead of being a weapon. So that it's at least doing something as it takes up an inventory slot for the rest of the game.
- You no longer have to worry about Psynergy items taking up your inventory as they can be sold and rebought as you please.

# Classic version (WIP)
Plays closer to the unmodded Golden Sun, with the most major difference between Jenna replaces Garet in the party.

# Known Issues...
- Graphical issues with some of Ivan's animations.

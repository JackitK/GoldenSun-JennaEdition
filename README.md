# Golden Sun: Jenna Edition
Golden Sun 1 with Jenna inserted into Garret's place includes Jenna's stats, class and Psynergy from Lost Age. Will (eventually) have two different patches, a "Modern" version and a "Classic" verison.

## Features Included In Both Verisons...
- Jenna takes Garet's place in the game and vice versa.  
- This means she will be in your party for the entire game, with her stats and abilities from Lost Age included.


## Extra Features in Modern Version
The Modern version has features to improve overworld traveling, and other quailty of life features that I first implemented in Dawn of Djinn.  Including...
- Skipping the prolouge, as well as Flint's tutorial.
- Being able to use Retreat as fast travel on the world map (as well as warping to the entrance of towns)
- Avoid not only being available from the start, but it now behaves as a literal on/off toggle, rather than how it behaves in vanilla.
- Scared Feathers now takes on an effect similar to the Djinni Quartz (60% chance to revive ally to half health)
- Quartz's abilty now acts as a 80 HP heal that is guartneed to revive if the ally is down.
- The adept ring got a buff, now recovering 15 PP to the target
- All Psynergy that is strictly utility costs 0 PP.
- A fire Psynergy equilvant to Growth, "Sunshine", is available on Jenna, regardless of her class.
- Ivan gains a new Psynergy, Gust, regardless of his class. It is an ulitiy exclusive Psynergy that functions like Whirlwind.
- Mia gains a new Psynergy, "Holy Ply". Outside of battle it lets you solve the puzzles of the Mercury Lighthouse. In battle, it heals a small amount PP to an ally. Mia will have access to this Psynergy, regardless of class.
- Ply from the orginal game is now refered to as "Healing Ply".
- Frost and Douse are battle exclusive Psynergy with "Chill" and "Rain" acting as their utility equivalent.
- Douse Drop and Frost Gem now bestow Rain and Chill respectully when equipped.
- Chill and Rain also appear in more classes than Frost and Douse normally would
- The Shaman's Rod also bestows Rain when equipped, instead of being a weapon. So that it's at least doing something as it takes up an inventory slot for the rest of the game.
- You no longer have to worry about Psynergy items taking up your inventory, as they can be sold and rebought as you please.
- Djinn no longer can runaway from you in battle.

## Noticable Issues and Other Disclaimers...
- Implementing fast travel in the Modern version does come at the cost of Bilbin Barricade no longer existing in the game normally. This is because the code that I use to implment this feature uses that location's map marker for Crossbone Isles to allow fast travel to that dungeon once you've reached it once.
- In the Modern version, do not leave Avoid on before saving and quitting the game as there is a bug with the ability that causes the toogle not to work properly if you do.  If you do run into the bug, transition between areas (such as the overworld and a town) while toogling the ability until it starts functioning again.
- Various items and Psynergy have been removed in order to fit Jenna's new moves and the new utility Psynergy. These are either items/Psynergy that only exist in the game's code and never actually used, or Psynergy you would normally not get access to post-Lv. 30. Neither of these should be a major issue since getting past level 30 in the first game is normally not possible without exessive grinding.
- In addition, the Fire Psynergy line has been replaced with the Beam Psynergy line.
- Certain enemies have their movepools slightly altered to make up for the lack of certain Psynergy.

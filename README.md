# Golden Sun: Jenna Edition
Golden Sun 1 with Jenna inserted into Garret's place includes Jenna's stats, class and Psynergy from Lost Age. Comes in one of two versions. "Classic" and "Convenience". 

# Convenience Verison
The convenience version has features to improve overworld traveling, that I first implemented in Dawn of Djinn.  Including...
- Skipping the prolouge as well as Flint's tutorial.
- Being able to use Retreat as fast travel on the world map (as well as warping to the entrance of towns)
- This does come at the cost of Bilbin Barricade (mostly) no longer existing in order to give a map marker to another part of the game.
- Avoid not only being available from the start, but behaving as a literal encounter toogle rather than a repel, like the vanilla version.
- Scared Feathers now heal 10 PP. The amount will slightly scale up the higher the target's max PP is.
- All Psynergy that is strictly ulity costing 0 PP.
- A fire Psynergy equilvant to Growth, Sunshine, is now on Jenna regardless of her class.
- Whirlwind is now exclusively a ulity Psynergy. However, Ivan has access to it no matter what his class is.
- Battle-wise, Gale replaces Whirlwind and has been buffed to have the same power as Whirlwind as a result.
- Ply is available on Mia regardless of her class.
- Douse Drop and Frost Gem now bestow Rain, and Chill respectully when equipped.  These "new" Psynergy behave simiarly to their OG equilvant, but they cost 0 PP to use and cannot be used in battle.
- Due to limitations of the tools I used to make this mod, Rain and Chill have no description, but besides that behave like normal.

# Classic version 
Plays closer to the unmodded Golden Sun, with the most major difference between Jenna replaces Garet in the party.
